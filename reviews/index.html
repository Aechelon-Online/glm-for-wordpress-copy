                I highly recommend Greg for his music talent and excellent music services! He quickly became part of the family with his welcoming smile and sense of humor. We loved his music/song performance for the first portion of my wedding before the dance floor DJ music services began! Excellent communication and planning! Thank you Greg for making my wedding night magical!

                Greg performed an acoustic set and DJ’d music from a playlist for our block party/fish Fry last weekend. It was fantastic! He is so talented, and entertaining!! The set up of his equipment looked great too. He read our crowd really well and played the perfect mix on both the acoustic set and the playlist. It was seamless. He came in and set up, while we went about our frying and visiting with our friends, with no fuss. Everyone really enjoyed the entertainment; It elevated the whole party. We will definitely be hiring Greg again! I highly recommend him, and so glad we went with the mixed set!!

                If you are looking for a DJ to not only keep the party/reception/event moving and entertaining your guests.....well look no further, Greg Luce is the only one you want to hire! We had an ever evolving timeline and he was always the most professional and up beat with ever single enhancement! He not only did the normal DJ stuff, but he sang, played acoustic and even wrapped up the night dancing with us....... he is amazing and so much fun! Don’t miss out when planning your next event!

                Greg has been playing at our Christmas party for several years now and we absolutely love to see him every year! He’s Jack of all trades and really knows how to throw a party on the dance floor! He’s an absolute delight, and cannot recommend him enough! 6/5 stars
